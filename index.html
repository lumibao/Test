  <div class="text-box" data-text="Panel 1:
The sun shines brightly. Illuminating the simple homes with thatched roofs. In the foreground, children with smiling faces are running on the sand, playing with their kite near the shore, dogs are sleeping soundly on the side of streets, and adults are chatting in the streets and laughing. I am standing on the porch of my home, a sense of peace in the air.
An interior shot. The main focus is on a small, shaky wooden door. I am shown with my hands pressed against it, my knuckles white, as it rattles violently in its frame. Outside the windows, what was once a gentle breeze has turned into a forceful, howling wind. The light outside has shifted from bright sunlight to a hazy, ominous gray. Leaves, dust, and small debris are visible swirling past the glass. The shadows inside the room stretch and shrink with the flickering light bulb in the ceiling, adding to the feeling of unease."></div>

  <div class="text-box" data-text="Panel 2:
A terrifying scene. A low-angle shot shows me straining with all my might against the door, my face a mask of fear and nervousness. Heavy rain falls in solid sheets, blurring the world outside. Through the streaks of rain on the window, the faint, ghostly shape of a massive wave can be seen crashing against a distant house. The sound is overwhelming, the high-pitched shriek of the wind is mixed with the deep roar of the ocean. Water begins to seep through the cracks around the door frame, a thin line of darkness against the light from the inside, a symbol of the storm's unstoppable force."></div>

  <div class="text-box" data-text="Panel 3:
A wide shot of absolute devastation, bathed in the gray, washed-out light of dawn. I am a small figure, walking alone through a sea of rubble. The homes are now just scraps and twisted metal. The peaceful streets are now filled with a random, chaotic mess of belongings, a child's muddy shoe, a ripped blanket, a broken chair, reflecting the sadness of the ground. The air smells of wet earth, salt, and decay, and the silence is oppressive, broken only by the crunch of my own footsteps."></div>

  <div class="text-box" data-text="Panel 4:
I am shown alongside other survivors, our faces streaked with dirt and exhaustion. We are not speaking, our focus is on the task at hand. Our hands are working, carefully moving heavy pieces of debris. A single, distinct detail draws the eye: a piece of bright, once red fabric is caught under a large pile of wood. Our heads are bowed in quiet grief, and the only sounds are the rustle of our movements and the heavy sighs of our shared sorrow. We are a silent, determined community, united in our tragic purpose."></div>

  <div class="text-box" data-text="Panel 5:
I am standing alone in the ruins of my former home, the remains of its walls barely standing. Around me, faint, translucent figures are visible. They are the ghosts of the 'Haiyan Dead.' Some are reaching out with arms half-raised, others are simply standing with heads bowed, lost in a never-ending silent search. Their presence creates a sense of profound sadness and loneliness. They are not menacing; they are simply a constant, mournful reminder of what was lost. The wind that destroyed the village now seems to carry their silent whispers."></div>

  <div class="text-box" data-text="Panel 6:
Years later, scars remain, but the spirit of survival shines brighter than the storm that tried to erase it. Hope, courage, and resilience live on in the hearts of those who endured. Every corner of the village, every stone, every remnant of a home tells a story of survival. Though the memories of that fateful day linger, life continues to grow, stronger and more beautiful than before."></div>
